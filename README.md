## About

## Local development

To develop for this site locally, first make sure your local environment is setup with:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Then perform the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/devrel-unconference/devrel-unconf-website.git

# cd in the project directory
cd devrel-unconf-website

# launch a local server of the dev environment
hugo server
```

Once that loads you will be able to view the local version at http://localhost:1313/, and any changes you make will be reflected locally.

If you want to submit changes, you'll need to fork the repo, and then repeat the steps above, with the `git clone` command using your fork. We recommend creating a branch for your changes, and then submitting a PR with the branch when you're ready.
